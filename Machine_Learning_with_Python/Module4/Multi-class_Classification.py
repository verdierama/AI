# #  **Softmax Regression, One-vs-All and One-vs-One for Multi-class Classification**
# 

# Estimated time needed: **1** hour
# 

#  In this lab, we will study how to convert a linear classifier into a multi-class classifier, including multinomial logistic regression or softmax regression, One vs. All (One-vs-Rest) and One vs. One.
# 

# ## **Objectives**
# 

# After completing this lab you will be able to:
# 

# *   Understand and apply some theory behind:
#     *  Softmax regression
#     *  One vs. All (One-vs-Rest)
#     * One vs. One
# 

# ## **Introduction**
# 

# In Multi-class classification, we classify data into multiple class labels. Unlike classification trees and k-nearest neighbor, the concept of multi-class classification for linear classifiers is not as straightforward. We can convert logistic regression to multi-class classification using multinomial logistic regression or softmax regression; this is a generalization of logistic regression, this will not work for support vector machines. One vs. All (One-vs-Rest) and One vs. One are two other multi-class classification techniques can convert any two-class classifier into a multi-class classifier.

# ## **Install and Import the required libraries**
# 

# For this lab, we are going to be using several Python libraries such as scit-learn, numpy, and matplotlib  for visualizations. Some of these libraries might be installed in your lab environment, and others may need to be installed by you by removing the hash signs. The cells below will install these libraries when executed.

# In ths lab we will use the  iris dataset,  it consists of three different types of irisesâ€™ (Setosa y=0, Versicolour y=1, and Virginica y=2), petal and sepal length, stored in a 150x4 numpy.ndarray.
# 
# The rows being the samples and the columns: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width.

# ## **Softmax Regression**  
# 

# SoftMax regression is similar to logistic regression, and the softmax function converts the actual distances, that is, dot products of $x$ with each of the parameters $\theta_i$ for the $K$ classes. This is converted to probabilities using the following: 
# 

# $softmax(x,i) = \frac{e^{ \theta_i^T \bf x}}{\sum_{j=1}^K e^{\theta_j^T x}} $
# 

# The training procedure is almost identical to logistic regression. Consider the three-class example where $y \in \{0,1,2\}$ we would like to classify $x_1$. We can use the softmax function to generate a probability of how likely the sample belongs to each class:
# 

# $[softmax(x_1,0),softmax(x_1,1),softmax(x_1,2)]=[0.97,0.2,0.1]$
# 

# The index of each probability is the same as the class. We can make a prediction using the argmax function:
# 

# $\hat{y}=argmax_i  \{softmax(x,i)\}$
# 

# For the previous example, we can make a prediction as follows:
# 

# $\hat{y}=argmax_i  \{[0.97,0.2,0.1]\}=0$
# 

# The <code>sklearn</code> does this automatically, but we can verify the prediction step, as we fit the model:
# 

# In[7]:


lr = LogisticRegression(random_state=0).fit(X, y)
print(lr)


# We generate the probability using the method <ocde>predict_proba</code>:
# 

# In[8]:


probability=lr.predict_proba(X)


# We can plot the probability of belonging to each class; each column is the probability of belonging to a class and the row number is the sample number.
# 

# In[9]:


plot_probability_array(X,probability)


# Here, is the output for the first sample:
# 

# In[10]:


probability[0,:]


# We see it sums to one.
# 

# In[11]:


probability[0,:].sum()
print(probability[0,:].sum())


# We can apply the $argmax$ function.
# 

# In[12]:


np.argmax(probability[0,:])
print(np.argmax(probability[0,:]))


# We can apply the $argmax$ function to each sample.
# 

# In[13]:


softmax_prediction=np.argmax(probability,axis=1)
softmax_prediction
print(softmax_prediction)


# We can verify that sklearn does this under the hood by comparing it to the output of the method <code> predict  </code>.
# 

# In[14]:


yhat =lr.predict(X)
accuracy_score(yhat,softmax_prediction)
print(accuracy_score(yhat,softmax_prediction))


# We can't use Softmax regression for SVMs, Let's explore two methods of Multi-class Classification that we can apply to SVM.
# 

# ## SVM 
# 

# Sklean performs Multi-class Classification automatically, we can apply the method and calculate the accuracy. Train a SVM classifier with the `kernel` set to `linear`, `gamma` set to `0.5`, and the `probability` paramter set to `True`, then train the model using the `X` and `y` data.

#ADD CODE
model = SVC(kernel='linear', gamma=.5, probability=True)
model.fit(X,y)
print(model)

# 
# ```python    
# model = SVC(kernel='linear', gamma=.5, probability=True)
# 
# model.fit(X,y)
# 
# ```
# 
# </details>
# 

# Find the `accuracy_score` on the training data.
# 

# In[18]:


yhat = model.predict(X)
accuracy_score(y,yhat)
print(accuracy_score)


# <details><summary>Click here for the solution</summary>

# We can plot the decision_boundary.

decision_boundary (X,y,model,iris)


# Let's implement One vs. All and One vs One:
# 

# ## One vs. All (One-vs-Rest) 
# 

# For one-vs-all classification, if we have K classes, we use K two-class classifier models. The number of class labels present in the dataset is equal to the number of generated classifiers. First, we create an artificial class we will call this "dummy" class. For each classifier, we split the data into two classes. We take the class samples we would like to classify, the rest of the samples will be labelled as a dummy class. We repeat the process for each class. To make a  classification, we use the classifier with the highest probability, disregarding the dummy class.
# 

# ### Train Each Classifier
# 

# Here, we train three classifiers and place them in the list <code>my_models</code>. For each class we take the class samples we would like to classify, and the rest will be labelled as a dummy class. We repeat the process for each class. For each classifier, we plot the decision regions. The class we are interested in is in red, and the dummy class is in blue. Similarly, the class samples are marked in blue, and the dummy samples are marked with a black x. 
#

#iterate through each class
for class_ in np.unique(y):

    select=(y==class_)
    temp_y=np.zeros(y.shape)
    #class, we are trying to classify 
    temp_y[y==class_]=class_
    #set other samples  to a dummy class 
    temp_y[y!=class_]=dummy_class
    #Train model and add to list 
    model=SVC(kernel='linear', gamma=.5, probability=True)    
    my_models.append(model.fit(X,temp_y))
    #plot decision boundary 
    decision_boundary (X,temp_y,model,iris)


#  For each sample we calculate the  probability of belonging to each class, not including the dummy class.
#

# We see the accuracy is less than the one obtained by sklearn, and this is because for SVM, sklearn uses one vs one; let's verify it by comparing the outputs. 
# 

# In[27]:


accuracy_score(one_vs_all,yhat)


# We see that the outputs are different, now lets implement one vs one.
# 

# ## One vs One 
# 

# 
# In One-vs-One classification, we split up the data into each class, and then train a two-class classifier on each pair of classes. For example, if we have class 0,1,2, we would train one classifier on the samples that are class 0 and class 1, a second classifier on samples that are of class 0 and class 2, and a final classifier on samples of class 1 and class 2.
# 
# For $K$ classes, we have to train $K(K-1)/2$ classifiers. So, if $K=3$, we have $(3x2)/2=3 $classes.
# 
# To perform classification on a sample, we perform a majority vote and select the class with the most predictions. 
# 

# Here, we list each class.
