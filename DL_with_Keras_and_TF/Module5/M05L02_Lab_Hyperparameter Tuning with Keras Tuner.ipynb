    "\n",
    "Congratulations on completing this lab! You have learned to set up Keras Tuner and prepare the environment for hyperparameter tuning. In addition, you defined a model-building function that uses hyperparameters to configure the model architecture. You configured Keras Tuner to search for the best hyperparameter configuration and learned to run the hyperparameter search and analyze the results. Finally, you retrieved the best hyperparameters and built a model with these optimized values. \n"
